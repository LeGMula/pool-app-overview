## System Architecture

### 1. Mobile Application (Flutter)

- **Framework**: Flutter SDK ^3.7.0
- **State Management**: Utilizes `flutter_bloc` and `hydrated_bloc` for efficient state handling
- **Key Features**: 
  - Real-time stock chart price & percentage change display
  - User authentication and verification
  - Dynamic updates for market data
- **Notable Dependencies**:
  - `flutter_bloc` for state management
  - `go_router` for navigation

#### Unique Solution: Error Handling

Our mobile app implements a sophisticated error handling mechanism using `flutter_bloc`:

```dart
class ErrorListener {
  void listener(BuildContext context, ErrorHandlerState state) {
    // Error handling logic
    if (state is TimeoutErrorState) {
      errorSnackBar = AppSnackBar(message: 'Server connection timeout. Please try again.');
    } else if (state is ValidationErrorState) {
      errorSnackBar = AppSnackBar(message: 'Server has returned an error. Please verify all information you have entered.');
    }
    // ... more error states ...
    
    if (errorSnackBar != null && showSnackBar) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(errorSnackBar);
    }
  }
}

2. Web Admin Portal (Angular)

Framework: Angular 16.0.5
Key Libraries:

@angular/platform-browser
@angular/router
@angular/common
@angular/core


Main Functionalities:

User authentication
Statistics display
Verification processes


State Management: Utilizes built-in Angular services for state management

While specific challenging features weren't identified, the complex nature of financial data handling and real-time updates presents ongoing challenges in development and optimization.
3. Backend Services (Python)

Framework: Django
Database: PostgreSQL, chosen for its robustness and support for advanced features
Key Services:

Profile management
Wallet operations
User verification
Market order processing



Complex API Endpoint Example: Wallet Withdrawal
pythonCopy@method_decorator(name='post', decorator=doc_decorator)
class WalletWithdrawView(APIView):
    permission_classes = (FanOnly, HasWallet, IsVerified)

    def post(self, request):
        serializer = WalletWithdrawSerializer(
            data=request.data, context={'user': request.user}
        )
        serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)

        withdrawal_service = OPPWithdrawalService()
        withdrawal_service.create(
            user=request.user,
            amount=serializer.data['amount'],
        )

        return Response()
This endpoint showcases our approach to handling complex financial transactions, incorporating multiple permission checks and service integrations.
